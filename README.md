## Movies-ETL Module 8 Challenge ##

The purpose of this analysis was to clean movie data from two sources: Wikipedia and ratings data from Kaggle to provide the Amazing Prime Streaming Video service with a clean data set for it's hackathon project where they are trying to determine which low budget films will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights for them. In order to clean the data from the two souces, we used the data pipeline process called Extract - Transform - Load.
